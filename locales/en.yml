  Technical Director (ex-CTO / co-founder) with 15+ years of experience building SaaS products. I design and industrialize product-facing AI capabilities (LLMs, RAG, agents — chat & voice) with a strong focus on shipping to production fast: cloud-native architecture, CI/CD, observability, performance, security and cost efficiency. Comfortable bridging hands-on AI execution with platform/DevEx acceleration.
