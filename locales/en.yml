  Technical Director (ex-CTO / co-founder) with 15+ years of experience building SaaS products. I design and ship product-facing AI capabilities (LLMs, RAG, agents — chat & voice) with a focus on industrialization: cloud-native, CI/CD, observability, performance, security and cost efficiency. I bridge hands-on AI execution with platform/DevEx acceleration.
